# Alt-Resfeber (not an another travel-app)

## Overview

The app gives the user a list of travel destinations to explore. Once logged in, the user can edit the travel destinations, create new ones, add them to favorites, and to leave comments.

## Technoligies used

The app uses JavaScript/jQuery/CSS/HTML, with a particular focus on using ExpressJS, MongoDB (with Mongoose). NPM packages include dotenv, bcrypt, express-session, ejs, method-override, body-parser.
The app was built using Skeleton framework.

## Future improvements

1. Use Google maps (API) to be centered on a clicked travel destination. Automatically display such a map when the user creates a new travel destination (by requesting the coordinates of the created destination from the geocoding API and using Google Maps API to show a map)

2. Ratings system for travel destinations

3. User profiles

The app is hosted on Heroku: [Resfeber (travel-app)](https://fathomless-chamber-12178.herokuapp.com/travel)
